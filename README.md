I am a young graphic & interface designer who is knowledgeable in graphic design and has strong social skills.
I started my education life in Ankara Gazi University Graphic Design Department in 2017. Then I transferred to
Akdeniz University Fine Arts Faculty Graphic Design Department in 2018 and graduated in 2021 with a grade of
3.25 / 4.00. While I was continuing my education at Akdeniz University, I was at the University of "Universidad
De Castilla La Mancha" in Cuenca, Spain for 6 months in 2019 as an "Erasmus Exchange Student".

If I need to mention my internship and work experience, I took part in the "NATO Internship" program as a graphic
design intern at NATO's S.H.A.P.E headquarters in Mons, Belgium between 06.2020 - 09.2020 and 06.2021 - 11.2021.

At B2 level, I can speak English fluently and Turkish as a mother tongue.

In my abilities, I can use Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom, HTML / CSS / JavaScript
/ PHP / Dart / Flutter and Microsoft Office programs well. I see myself as an interface designer & developer in a company
working on flutter in the future.

My hobbies include reading, traveling, camping, photography and drawing.

I describe myself as someone who is determined, disciplined and compatible with teamwork and has a solution-oriented approach.
